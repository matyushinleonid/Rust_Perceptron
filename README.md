# Rust_Perceptron, ISP course project at Skoltech

## Description:
Perceptron regression model. We minimize MSE loss with SGD for training.

## Structure:
 * params.txt contains learning rate and a batch size.
 * X_train.txt contains training feature matrix, number of rows equals to the batch size, number of columns equals to the number of features.
 * y_train.txt contains true y's.
 * X_test contains test feature matrix.

## Usage: 
Set your own params, X_train, y_train, X_test and execute

*cargo run*
